## Partially anticipated ##
A computation *E* is partially anticipated at a point *p* if there is a path *P* from
*p* to a computation at a point *q* and *E* is preserved along *P*.
*Jonas's definition:* An expression is **anticipated** at a point *p* in the CFG if
it is certain that it will be evaluated with all operands having the same
value on all paths to *p*.

## Fully anticipated ##
A computation *E* is fully anticipated at a point *p* if it is partially anticipated
along every path from *p* to program exit.

## Down safe ##
A point *q* is down-safe with respect to a computation *E*, if *E* is **fully**
**anticipated** at *q*. Since *SSAPRE* is not allowed to to add computations which
wouldn't be there otherwise, the following code can't be optimized:
```
while (a < b)
    i += x * y;
    a++;
```
Since the `while` loop might never run, this can be fixed by changing the
`while` into an `if` and `do-while`.

SSAPRE
======

* phi == little phi
* PHI == big phi

1.  Insert PHI-functions. PHI is inserted at `DF+(R + A)`, where
    R is the set of vertices with real occurrences of E, and A is the set of
    vertices with assignments to an operand of E.
2.  Rename. All occurrences (real, PHI, and PHI-operand). Renaming uses the
    SSA-renaming algorithm. PHI-operands corresponding to another PHI-operand
    is set to `*BOTTOM*`.
3.  Finalize1
    *   Downsafety: PHI is downsafe if there is a real occurrence of the
        computation after PHI but before the program exit or modification of
        the computation's value after the PHI function. SSAPRE may not add a
        computation which might not be used at all. I.e. in the following code,
        `x * y` might never be needed.
        ```
        while (a < b)
        i += x * y;
        a++;
        ```
        This can be fixed by changing
        the `while` into an `if` and `do-while`.

    *   Availability: Find the PHI-functions where an expression safely can be
        made available, and then find the latest point to insert the expression
        (reduce live ranges). `can_be_available` is set to `false` if the
        PHI-function is not downsafe and has a `*BOTTOM*` operand, this
        propagated to every operand's definition. `later` is initially set to
        `can_be_available`, but if there exits an operand which is not
        `*BOTTOM*`and has a real use, then it is set to false (and propagated
        to each operand).

    *   Modify: For each PHI-function which satisfy `will_be_available`
        (`can_be_avail && !later`), the expression is inserted at each incoming
        edge where the expression is not available.

4.  Finalize2: Set a `save` flag at each real occurrence that should save its
    computation.
