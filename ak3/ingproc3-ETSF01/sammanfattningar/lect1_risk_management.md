#Risk Management
"A risk is a potential problem; a problem is a risk that has materialized" [Fairley 1994]

###What can go wrong?
 * Staff turn-around: quit, moved to other project, illness
 * Tools do not work as anticipated
 * Requirements change more than expected
 * Effort estimates were wrong
 * Expected input/deliveries are delayed
 * Quality is not good enough in the end of the project

###What is risk?
 "An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objective"
 It consists of both a **cause** and an **effect**
 For example:

 - Use of new compiler (**cause**)
 
  Integration problem && delayed training phase (**effect**)

 - Low top management priority in Project A (**cause**)

   Resources (staff) moved from project A to another project (**effect**)
