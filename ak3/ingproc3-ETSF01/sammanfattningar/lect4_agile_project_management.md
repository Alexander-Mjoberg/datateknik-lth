# Agile project management

Agile is a name for many different methods, each of these implementation is unique. 
The included methods are Scrum, XP, and Kanban.

## The Agile manifesto
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Agile projects

Traditional development:
```
|Requirements->|Design->|Implementation->|Testing->| Done!
```
Agile development:
```
|R->|D->|I->|T->|
                |R->|D->|I->|T->|
                                |R->|D->|I->|T->| 
                                                  Done!
```

Agile focuses on...
* Maximizing return on investment (ROI), delivering business value.
* Quickly delivering working code.
* _Expecting_ and managing changes.

Agile SPM involves gradual detailing, prioritized work order that are just-in-time, and independent teams.

### Exploration
* Define high-level requirements
* Prioritize from business perspective
* Explore / prototype

### Planning 
* Prioritize user stories
* Backlog (scrum)
* Story cards, story board, Kanban board
* Re-estimate, for each sprint
* Select set of stories for iteration according to capacity

#### Kanban board 
Simplest version - columns for to-do, in progress, done

Common version - Backlog, Ready, Coding, Testing, Approval, Done columns

Used to, visualize workflow, limit work-in-progress, pull work from column to column, monitor, adapt, improve etc.

### Time boxing 
* Time-box fixed deadline by which something has to be delivered
* Typically two to six week iterations
* Develop the most prioritized stories first

### Development 
* Iterations a.k.a. sprints
  – Scrum: 30 days prescribed, but varies in reality
  – XP: shorter, 2 weeks
* Work in prio order
  – Scrum: team chooses stories in sprint planning
  – XP: team chooses stories strictly according to agreed prio
* Managing change
  – Scrum: no changes in scope / stories during sprint
  – XP: changes allowed
