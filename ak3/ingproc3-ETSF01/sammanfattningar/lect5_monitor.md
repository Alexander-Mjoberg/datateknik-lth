Representatives for key stakeholders and involved organisational
units. Support project sponsor by providing multiple perspectives.

**Project manager** Day-to-day resp to ensure project meets goals
(Scope-Time-Cost) by planning and managing project and project
team. Secure acceptance of deliverables from sponsor and stakeholders.

**Stakeholders: Key and other** All project roles and others who

available to project on matters of customer interests, e.g.
regarding requirements and acceptance of deliveriables.

**Vendors** Contracted to deliver products or services to the

## Organizational structures
An organizational structure is needed to form and manage 
groups in large projects. 

### Formal versus informal
The *formal* structure focuses on *authority*, about who has which
boss. This is usually the base of the organization's structure.
When the "unexpected happens" the *informal* structure takes over,
this structure consists of spontaneous contact and communication
between the members of the staff while working.
The informal organization gets built up and unofficial ways are
found around the obstacles imposed by the formal structure.

### Hierarchical approach
Each member of the staff only has one manager, and the manager 
has responsibility for several staff members. Authority flows
top down. A concern with this approach is *span of control* - 
the number of people that a manager control.

### Staff versus line
*Line* workers produce the end product, support *staff* carry out
supporting roles (think IT-department).
