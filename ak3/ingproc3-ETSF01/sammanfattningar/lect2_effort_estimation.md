Effort Estimation
=================

## Problems with Effort Estimation ##
 Subjective nature of estimating
  * Difficult to produce evidence in support of decision
* Changing techologies
  * these bring uncertainties, especially in the early days when there is a
  'learning curve'
* Projects differ
  * Experience on one project may not be applicable to another
* Political pressure
  * Managers may wish to reduce estimated costs in order to win support for
  acceptance of a project proposal
* Covering your own back
  * Avoid later overtime

## Effort or Cost? ##

```
Effort == work required e.g. person/man-hours
```

__Cost includes:__
* Person-hours (salaries, benefits)
* Moving and living costs for new staff members
* Training
* Travel costs
* Legal & Licensing fees (software, patents, copyright)
* Contractors and subcontractors
* Equipment
* Currency exchange rates
* Marketing & Advertising
* Inflation rate

## Over- and under-estimating ##

### Parkinson's Law ###
> Work expands to fill the time available

### Brooks's ###
> Putting more people on a late job makes it later

### Weinberg's Zeroth Law of reliability ###
> a software project that does not have to meet a reliability requirement
> can meet any other requirement

Vad betyder då den här lagen? Jo det ska ni få veta! (Brace yourselves) Lagen
innebär att ifall projektet inte har en tydligt specificerad krav på 
tillförlitlighet när det ska skeppas så kan detta arbiträrt väljas. Vilket
resulterar i sämre kvalitet som sedan visas i __testning__ eller senare faser.

* Over-estimations => project likely to take longer
* Under-estimations => lower quality in order to meet target

## When & Why ##
* Strategic planning
* Feasability study
* Requirements spec
* Evaluation of suppliers' proposals
* Project planning

## What don't we know? ##
* Customers' needs & expectations - requirements
* Technical complexity & design components
* Reuse - internal and external components
* People
  * Skills, competence and experience
  * Co-operation & communication
* ... (srsly wtf, why the dots here grrl?)

## Bottom-up versus top-down estimation ##

### Bottom-up ###
* Identify all tasks that have to be done (top-down)
* Estimate tasks of 1-2 mw, accumulate effort bottom-up
* Time consuming
* Useful when no past project data for similar projects exist
