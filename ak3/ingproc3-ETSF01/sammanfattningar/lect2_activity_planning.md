# Activity planning

> Time is natures way of stopping everything happening at once.

## The objectives of activity planning
  - Feasability assessment
  Is the project possible within the required timescales and resources?
  - Resource allocation
  What are the most effective ways of allocating resources? When should
  the resources be available?
  - Detailed costing
  How much will the project cost? After producing an activity plan, we can
  obtain more detailed estimates of costs.
  - Motivation
  Providing targets and monitoring progress can motivate staff.
  - Coordination
  When do the staff need to be transfered between projects to increase 
  efficiency?

## Different types of planning
 * Iterative planning
 * Gradual detailing

## Activity networks

 ```
           ____  
          |____| 
    ____ /      \ ____
-->|____|        |____|-->
         \ ____ /
          |____|
 ```

 Activity networks can be used to assess the feasability of the projects completion
 date, identify when resources are needed, calculate when costs incur, and to coordinate
 the staff between tasks.

## Defining activities
  
  An activity includes:

  * Start and end-time
  * Resource requirements
  * Duration
  * Dependencies

## Identifying activities

  There are three approaches to identifying the activities or tasks:

  - Activity based planning
  Creating a list of all the activities that the project needs. Can be done by creating 
  a **Work Breakdown Structure** (WBS). This involves identifying the main tasks that are 
  needed for the project and then breaking them down into lower-level tasks. Too great depth
  will result in a large number of small tasks that will be diffcult to manage. Too shallow
  project provides insufficient detail.

  - Product-based approach
