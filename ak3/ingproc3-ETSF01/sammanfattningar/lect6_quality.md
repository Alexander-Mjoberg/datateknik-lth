## Clear criterias for activities/inspections
* Entry requirements - test data and expected results prepared
* Implementation requirements - "when error is found, do this and that"
* Exit requirements - done when all tests ok

## When are we done?

has to be estimated. Using testing techniques or expert opinion.
