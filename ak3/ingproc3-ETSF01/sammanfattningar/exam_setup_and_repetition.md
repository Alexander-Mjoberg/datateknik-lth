### PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)

Expected time (t\_e) = (minimum time (a) + 4 * medium time (m) + worst time (b)) / 6
Standard deviation (S) = (worst time (b) - minimum time (a))/6

* Study - Study/Check/Assess the outcome; measure and report
* Act - Decide on needed changes -> repeat
* Plan - Plan goal & process design/revision to improve results
* Do - Implement plan & measure performance


## Resource Allocation (Lecture 4)
A resource includes labour, equipment, materials, space, services etc.
### Allocation step by step
1. Identify resources needed and create a resource requirements list.
2. Identify resource types, resources within a group are interchangeble, and resources between groups are not.
3. Allocate resource types to activites, and examine each resource type histogram.
4. If resources needed exceeds the available resources at some time, perform resource smoothing.

* Resource histograms, where the first is before resource smoothing. Available resources are the dotted line, 
  and the required are shown with lines.
```

## Monitor (Lecture 5)

### Earned value analysis

#### Basics 
Earned value analysis is based on assigning a "value" to each task or work, based on the original expenditures forecasts.

* Planned value (PV) or Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS): Original estimate
* Earned value (EV) or Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP): Work completed this far
* Actual cost (AC) or Actual cost of work performed (ACWS): Actual work performed this far
* Budget at completion (BAC): The budget when the project is done
* Estimate at completion (EAC): Estimated budget at completion, updated as the project progresses

#### Performance ratios

Value for money.

* Cost performance indicator (CPI) = EV / AC
* Schedule performance indicator (SPI) = EV/PV
* Estimated Actual Cost = BAC / CPI    

#### Example 
```
BAC = 100
Actal cost = 80
|===========>        |
    EV = 60 ^        ^ PV = 100
```

* CPI = EV / AC = 60 / 80 = 75 % => over budget
* SPI = EV / PV = 60 / 100 = 60 %
* EAC = BAC / CPI = 100 / 0.75 = 133

* Cost variance = EV - AC = 60 - 80 = -20
* Budget variance = PV - AC = 100 - 80 = 20
* Schedule variance = EV - PV = 60 - 100 = -40

## Cost Benifit Evaluation (Lecture 6)
* **Return on investment (ROI) or also known as Accounting rate of return (ARR) 
  = Net profit / total investment.** 
  *Also useful for company individual choices
  or features.*
* **Net profit:** 
  - total income - total cost
* **Payback period:** 
  - time to break even

```
      average annual profit
ROI =---------------------- X 100
        total investment

        value in year t
NPV =----------------------
            (1 + r)^t
```
