Lecture 3
=========

* Why Focus on processes?
  * Processes affect **product** **quality**
  * Processes affect **people**, **schedule** and **technology**
  * Software is more design intense => people dependent

## Process Management for Software ##
* **CMMI:** Capability Maturity Model Integration, software certification
  similar to ISO
* **PSP:** Personal Software Process
* **TSP:** Team Software Process

## Software process improvement ##
1. Evaluation of current practices
1. Planning for improvements
1. Imlementing improvements
1. Evaluation of effects

## The Deming Cycle - PDSA ##

```
... => Plan => Do => Study => Act => Plan => ...
```

These steps are also known as the "*General Steps for SPI*"
(Software process improvement)

* Study - Study/Check/Assess the outcome; measure and report
* Act - Decide on needed changes -> repeat
* Plan - Plan goal & process design/revision to improve results
* Do - Implement plan & measure performance

## SPI approaches ##

### Prescriptive ###
Top-down approaches

Examples: CMMI, SPICE

### Inductive ###
Bottom-up approaches

Examples: QIP, iFLAP, Lean Six Sigma

* Process modelling and simulation
* Information flow analysis
* Retrospective reflection aka Lessons learnt, project post-mortem

### CMM & CMMI ###
__C__apability __M__aturity __M__odel for Software (SW-CMM)

* Mission to promote software technology transfer, particularly to defense
  contractors
* Maturity model proposed in mid-80s and later refined to __CMMI__ in early 90s
* Work has been very influential in process improvement

CMMI was introduced to bring together models produced for different environments
into a single integrated framework. These models place organizations at one of
five levels of process maturity which indicate the sophistication and quality of
their production practices. These levels are defined as follows.

* **Level 1** *Initial*: The procedures followed tend to be haphazard. Some
  projects may be successful, but this tends to be because of the skills of
  particular individuals, including project managers. There is no level 0 and
  so any organization would be at this level by default.
* **Level 2** *Managed*: Organizations at this level will have basic project
  management procedures in place. The way, however, individual tasks are carried
  out will depend largely on the person doing it.
* **Level 3** *Defined*: The organization has defined the way that each task in
  the software development life cycle should be done.
* **Level 4** *Quantitatively managed*: The products and processes involved in
  software development are subject to measurement control.
* **Level 5** *Optimizing*: Improvement in procedures can be designed and
  implemented using the data gathered from the measurement process.

### SPICE ###
__S__oftware __P__rocess __I__mprovement __C__apability d__E__termination model

* Developed from CMM
* Parts of SPICE defined as ISO standard
* Consists of:
  * Process dimension: assessment per process area
  * Capability dimension: how processes are impl and managed
* Particularly appropriate for small organisations (ability to focus on process
  areas)
