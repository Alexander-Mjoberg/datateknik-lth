Lecture 3
=========

* Why Focus on processes?
  * Processes affect **product** **quality**
  * Processes affect **people**, **schedule** and **technology**
  * Software is more design intense => people dependent

## Process Management for Software ##
* **CMMI:** Capability Maturity Model Integration, software certification
  similar to ISO
* **PSP:** Personal Software Process
* **TSP:** Team Software Process

## Software process improvement ##
1. Evaluation of current practices
1. Planning for improvements
1. Imlementing improvements
1. Evaluation of effects

## The Deming Cycle - PDSA ##

```
... => Plan => Do => Study => Act => Plan => ...
```

These steps are also known as the "*General Steps for SPI*"
(Software process improvement)

* Study - Study/Check/Assess the outcome; measure and report
* Act - Decide on needed changes -> repeat
* Plan - Plan goal & process design/revision to improve results
* Do - Implement plan & measure performance

## SPI approaches ##

### Prescriptive ###
Top-down approaches

Examples: CMMI, SPICE

### Inductive ###
Bottom-up approaches

Examples: QIP, iFLAP, Lean Six Sigma

* Process modelling and simulation
* Information flow analysis
* Retrospective reflection aka Lessons learnt, project post-mortem

### CMM & CMMI ###
__C__apability __M__aturity __M__odel for Software (SW-CMM)

* Mission to promote software technology transfer, particularly to defense
  contractors
* Maturity model proposed in mid-80s and later refined to __CMMI__ in early 90s
* Work has been very influential in process improvement

CMMI was introduced to bring together models produced for different environments
into a single integrated framework. These models place organizations at one of
five levels of process maturity which indicate the sophistication and quality of
their production practices. These levels are defined as follows.

* **Level 1** *Initial*: The procedures followed tend to be haphazard. Some
  projects may be successful, but this tends to be because of the skills of
  particular individuals, including project managers. There is no level 0 and
  so any organization would be at this level by default.
  * Frequently difficulties in making commitments
  * Crises common
  * Success depends entirely on having exceptional managers and developers
  * Level 1 companies, however, can deliver products
* **Level 2** *Managed (Repeatable, in slides)*: Organizations at this level
  will have basic project management procedures in place. The way, however,
  individual tasks are carried out will depend largely on the person doing it.
  * Policies for managing software projecs are implemented
  * Realistic commitments
  * Capability: disciplined, earlier successes can be repeated
* **Level 3** *Defined*: The organization has defined the way that each task in
  the software development life cycle should be done.
  * A typical process for developing and maintaining software in the
    organisation is defined
  * A Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG) is defined
  * Capabilitiy: standard and consistent - both software engineering and
    management are stable and repeatable
* **Level 4** *Quantitatively managed*: The products and processes involved in
  software development are subject to measurement control.
  * The organization sets quantitative quality goals for both products and
    processes
  * Software products are of high predictable quality
  * Organization-wide metrics database
  * Meaningful variations can be distinguished from noise
  * Capability: predictable
* **Level 5** *Optimizing*: Improvement in procedures can be designed and
  implemented using the data gathered from the measurement process.
  * The whole organization is focused on continous process improvement
  * The organisation has the means to identify process weaknesses and take
    actions
  * Cost benefit analysis possible

The evaluation is performed by a team of assessors coming into the organization
and interviewing key staff about their practices, using a standard questionnaire
to capture the information. A key objective is not just to assess, but to
recommend specific actions to bring the organization up to a higher level.

* Contains 25 process areas, e.g. requirements management, quality assurance etc
* Each process area contains goals and practices
* Two types of models
  * Staged: grades the overall development process
  * Continous: grades each process area

### SPICE ###
__S__oftware __P__rocess __I__mprovement __C__apability d__E__termination model

* Developed from CMM
* Parts of SPICE defined as ISO standard
* Consists of:
  * Process dimension: assessment per process area
  * Capability dimension: how processes are impl and managed
* Particularly appropriate for small organisations (ability to focus on process
  areas)
