# Lecture 4 - resource allocation

In general:

How labor, equipment, space etc. should be distributed to acquire the highest possible efÔ¨Åciency.
Performed after activities, effort, and risks have been identified.

* The right amount of people for each job.
* The right amount of work for each employee.


## Schedules
* Activity schedules

   Indicating start and completion dates for each activity.
* Resource schedule

   Indicating dates when resources needed and the levels of available resources.
* Cost schedule

   Showing accumulative costs, total spending over time.

## Resource allocation
* Resource types
  * Includes labour, equipment, materials, space, services etc.
  * Time (duration)

     Can often be reduced by adding more staff.
  * Money

     Used to buy other types of resources.

### Allocation step by step
1. Identify resources needed and create a resource requirements list.
2. Identify resource types, resources within a group are interchangeble, and resources between groups are not.
3. Allocate resource types to activites, and examine each resource type histogram.
4. If resources needed exceeds the available resources at some time, perform resource smoothing.
